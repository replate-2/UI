    <h2> FOOD </h2>
    <p> Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.

      We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Use what you see, don't plan it. You can do it. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Poor old tree. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be.</p>
