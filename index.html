     <h2 class='replateh2'> Our Mission </h2>
    <p> Did you know that around 300,000,000 pounds of food goes to waste each day in the United States? Did you also know that 38,000,000 people are living in poverty in the United States as well? What if there was a way to help out both of these problems? Well, now there is! Replateâ€™s cutting edge and innovative technology connects businesses with surplus food they wish to donate to the very people that need it most. </p>

        <h2 class='replateh2'> Community </h2>
      <p> Here at Replate we strongly believe in community. By connecting your business into a network of other businesses and organizations in your area you will not only be doing a great deed, but it will also help your business grow by getting its name out there. Small businesses that help their local communities often see an increase in customers. When a business does great things for their area it inspires others in the community to do great things as well. </p>

       <h2 class='replateh2'> Pick Up</h2>
      <p> We understand that running a business is both stressful and time consuming, so our goal is to make your generous donations go as smooth as possible. We will send some of our amazing drivers and crew to come to you. Not only will we pick up the surplus food you have, we will load it ourselves, and even personally drop off your charitable tax paperwork at the end of the year. Believe it or not, we make it so easy that most businesses that have signed up with us find it more convenient and time saving than their prior methods of handling their surplus food.  </p>
