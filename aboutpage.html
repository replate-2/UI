    <p> Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. You gotta think like a tree. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.

      Be brave. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect.</p>
